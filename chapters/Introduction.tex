\chapter*{Introduction}

This work is structured as follows. Chapter 

Throughout this document, the following conventions are adopted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lowercase latin indexes, e.g. i, j and k, vary on the three spatial coordinates, generally as 1, 2 e 3 or x, y e z;
    \item Lowercase greek indexes, e.g. $\mu$, $\nu$ and $\lambda$, vary on the four spacetime coordinates;
    \item The Einstein summation convention is used.
    \item The speed of light, Planck constant and the electric permittivity are assumed to be equal to one.
    \item Both particle and antiparticle states are taken for the cross section calculation.
\end{itemize}
